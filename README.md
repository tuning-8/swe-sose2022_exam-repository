# OpenMensa Parser in C#
## OpenMensa
[OpenMensa](https://openmensa.org/#5/48.893/11.194) is a free database for canteens and cafeterias in Germany. The website provides the menus of over one thousand canteens. OpenMensa is completely free and collaborative developed.

## Project overview
The aim of this Project is the creation of a website parser to primarily collect the menu data from the TU Freiberg canteen. The project is made in the context of the exam for the module ['Softwareentwicklung'](https://github.com/ComputerScienceLecturesTUBAF/SoftwareentwicklungSoSe2022_Projektaufgaben).
Detailed information about this project can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/tuning-8/swe-sose2022_exam-repository/wiki)

## License
Currently the software is not under any specific license, but feel free to take inspiration from our code for creating a new parser to support the OpenMensa project.
